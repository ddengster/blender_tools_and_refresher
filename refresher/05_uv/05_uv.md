- Select a face in the scene and press A to select all faces.

- Adjust the polygons on the left side as you see fit. You can manipulate them with the QWERT keys, and 1/2/3 keys to select verts/edges/faces

- You can also load in an image on the left panel, but usually if the model is already prepped by an artist it should be there
