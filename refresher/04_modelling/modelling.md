- There is a bunch of tools you can use, whose icons are located at the left sidebar

- Transform tools will work as usual on vertices/faces/edges (with some exceptions)

- **Alt-LeftClick** will select a loop of edges/faces, very useful!

### Modelling via Extruding

- Select a face/edge, press E, and move your mouse
